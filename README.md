# Minesweeper

Welcome to my version of Minesweeper.

I was once asked in an interview how I would go about building minesweeper. Since it was one of my favorite time wasters during college, I thought I'd take a stab at actually building it. This is the result.

### Built with Backbone

This version is built with backbone.js, and should support all the original game's functionality with the exception of the pro-mode double mouse-click reveals (which I hope to add in at some point).

### Play it
