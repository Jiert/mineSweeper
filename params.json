{"name":"Minesweeper","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my version of Minesweeper.\r\nI was once asked in an web development interview how I would go about building minesweeper. At the time I was fairly wet behind the ears and didn't really have the experience to build it properly. So I went home and tried to do it with no help from the web. Again, it didn't go well, so I put the idea away for another day. A few years later, I tried it again, and this is the result.\r\n\r\n### Built with Backbone\r\nThis version is built with backbone.js, and should support all the original game's functionality with the exception of the pro-mode double mouse-click reveals (which I hope to add in soon).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
